 Module 6 Homework
A script that transforms information from "cities.csv" into scatter plots and geoapis.

## Description
The script runs through the rows of the spreadsheet to locate data that was formed into dataframes to present linear regression scatterplots based on certain categories. The information is then transformed into descriptive map plots of the northern and southern hemispheres, and printed on the juypter notebook output, a data conclusion of the r-vaules and the linear regression's correlation.
